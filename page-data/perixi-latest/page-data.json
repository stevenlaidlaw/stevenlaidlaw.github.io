Whether you’re an author, world-builder, or someone who likes creating, Perixi is designed to bring wiki-like links, images, and markdown-like editing to your process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/perixiPreview.jpg\" alt=\"Perixi Preview\"></p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>My inspiration was frustration at a lack of a cross-platform tool that could give me Wiki-like features on my personal machine. I looked for months for the perfect app to use while writing, but couldn’t find it, so out of that frustration I decided to build it myself. I never intended to release it, but as I was building it I realised it could be useful to quite a few people, and so made the decision to polish it up to something that everyone could use.</p>\n<h3>Where</h3>\n<p>Click to download the latest version of Perixi for your OS</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stevenlaidlaw-loan-repayment-calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/Perixi-1.1.0-WIN.exe\">Windows (1.1.0)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stevenlaidlaw-loan-repayment-calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/Perixi-1.1.1-OSX.dmg\">OSX (1.1.1)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stevenlaidlaw-loan-repayment-calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/Perixi_1.1.1_amd64.deb\">Linux (1.1.1)</a> [deb amd64]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/perixiIcon.jpg\" alt=\"Perixi Icon\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Perixi","date":"January 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/perixi-latest/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/overengineered-todo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learn Docker via an Over-engineered Todo"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1452170872","3128451518"]}
