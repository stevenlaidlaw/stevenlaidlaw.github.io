If you’re a competent software engineer at a large tech company, your time is in very high demand. Lots of people will want you to do things1. You should be very selective about how you handle these requests, and definitely avoid saying yes to everyone.

Helping other people feels good. That’s doubly true when those people are from other parts of the company. It feels like you’re having the kind of cross-org impact that a staff+ engineer ought to be having. But helping other parts of the org is not your main job. Delivering projects is your main job. It’s a common trap to spend your time too generously and neglect the projects that are your actual responsibility. To avoid it, you should identify the people who are trying to claim your time.

## Identifying predators

Large tech companies are full of predators: people who want to extract uncompensated work from competent engineers who are generous with their time. Once a predator identifies a good target, they will routinely send work to that person via DMs instead of going through normal channels. “Uncompensated” is a key word here. When your manager asks you to do work, that isn’t predatory, because you’re being paid for it and (hopefully) rewarded for it at review time. When a colleague asks you to do work, that isn’t predatory, because they’re in a position to do you a favor as well. Predators are asking you to do work that gives them a lot of value but doesn’t do anything for you (or is even harmful). Let’s look at some examples.

One common type of predator is a product manager from a different part of the org. I want to be clear that most product managers don’t do this. But in every large org there will be a couple of this type among the product folks, because they’re typically results-oriented people and they’re used to squeezing work out of engineers. Requests from this kind of predator look like this in Slack DMs:

- “I know you don’t technically own this part of the codebase, but could you make a tiny change for me real quick?”
- “I got this (unrelated to your work) technical question from another PM, what’s the answer?”
- “You’re so great at using our data tooling, can you pull some statistics for me when you get a sec?”
- “My team is doing this project that’s related to your part of the codebase, could you make a change here to unblock them?”

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
