<h2>What</h2>
<p>Perixi is a desktop app designed from the ground up to make it easier to plan your story. Whether you're an author, world-builder, or someone who likes creating, Perixi is designed to bring wiki-like links, images, and markdown-like editing to your process.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>My inspiration was frustration at a lack of a cross-platform tool that could give me Wiki-like features on my personal machine. I looked for months for the perfect app to use while writing, but couldn't find it, so out of that frustration I decided to build it myself. I never intended to release it, but as I was building it I realised it could be useful to quite a few people, and so made the decision to polish it up to something that everyone could use.</p>
