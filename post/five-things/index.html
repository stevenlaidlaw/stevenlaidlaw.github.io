					<h2>Things I learned Writing Pulse</h2>
					<h6>Tue, Jan 19, 2016</h6>
					
					<p>I&rsquo;m a regular reader of Chuck Wendig&rsquo;s blog, <a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/blog/">TerribleMinds</a>, and one of the things he does every now and then is gets guest posters to talk about what they learned while writing a novel. Because I&rsquo;m not cool enough to appear on his blog yet I figured I&rsquo;d steal his idea and write about it on my own blog anyway. I&rsquo;m not going to go into publishing or design at all on this, and try to keep it purely about the writing. Those things can go into another post.</p>

<p>Sooooooo here we go, the things I learned writing Pulse.</p>

<p><strong>1. You don&rsquo;t have to get it right on the first try</strong></p>

<p>Pulse started as my attempt at NaNoWriMo in 2014. I&rsquo;d written a lot of stuff for myself before then. I&rsquo;d taken a course on grammar. I&rsquo;d read two books on writing, and countless articles and blogs. I had written out a full synopsis for the story. I was ready to go. Then November hit, and I started writing. Two weeks in I&rsquo;d hit 30,000 words, and while I was happy with my progress I was <em>not</em> happy with my story. At all. I hated it, in fact. I loved the idea, but the story itself just felt rushed to me.</p>

<p>So I decided to restart the novel. Halfway through November I trashed all the chapters I&rsquo;d written, did a rejig of the plan, and started writing again. I only made it to 10,000 words before giving up. It just didn&rsquo;t feel right. I got depressed about it, and didn&rsquo;t want to write. That was my first attempt at NaNo, and my first failure. I was dejected about the story, and didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>

<p>So I stopped writing that story. I sat down, planned out a different story, and a few weeks later started writing that one. It wasn&rsquo;t until a few months later in January that the solution to Pulse came to me. It&rsquo;s not a single story. It&rsquo;s too big for that, and there is no way I could give the proper perspective within only 100,000 words. That was the day I decided to split it out into a trilogy.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t start right away. No, I did something else, which leads into the next thing I learned&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>2. A complete plan makes writing 1000x easier</strong></p>

<p>In the past I&rsquo;d written rough outlines, usually in the form of a one page synopsis. I thought this was preparing well. It wasn&rsquo;t. This didn&rsquo;t let me know how I was going to fill a book. This didn&rsquo;t show me the ups and downs of the novel. This didn&rsquo;t show me character arcs, or sub-plots. So what I did this time, instead of diving right in to the writing, was read. I read as many books as I could stomach on planning, but one in particular held my notice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Engineering-Larry-Brooks/dp/1582979987">Story Engineering, by Larry Brooks</a>.</p>

<p>This book has become my bible. While it&rsquo;s quite wordy and has a few too many examples, the structure inside is the best thing I&rsquo;ve come across as a tool for writing. I won&rsquo;t go into details of the plan, you can find it elsewhere online or just get the book and learn it yourself. I also can&rsquo;t guarantee it will change your writing as it did mine. All I can say is that it worked for me. Well.</p>

<p>Now my plans are thorough. They tell me everything my characters are doing, and why they are doing it. I can now get a lot more intimate with my characters, and know everything about them, and so can have them act in a more realistic and believable way when these obstacles are thrown in their path. I spent two weeks perfecting the plan for Pulse and then dove into the writing.</p>

<p><strong>3. Alpha readers are amazing</strong></p>

<p>Nothing is better than people who read your novel. You need other eyes on it. You&rsquo;re too close. You can&rsquo;t be objective. We all get this in beta reading, but what about someone who is picking up your mistakes along the way? What if you&rsquo;re heading in the wrong direction? This is where the alphas come in. Every time I would finish a chapter I would post it up on Google Docs and share the link with my two readers. Within a day or two I would have comments from both of them on what they thought about it.</p>

<p>This was fantastic not just as a tool for understanding my story, but also <em>staying motivated to write!</em> Nothing stirs the loins of the inner pen like people getting excited to read another chapter. Nothing. I owe the completion of the first draft of my novel to my two friends who did this for me. I doubt I would have been able to finish it without them.</p>

<p><strong>4. Let it rest</strong></p>

<p>I was done with the novel. Finally, for the first time in my life, I&rsquo;d completed a full novel! I was officially (in my mind at least) an author. This was the first time I&rsquo;d ever felt like I&rsquo;d completed something that was worth it. I was ecstatic. I wanted to get it out there. I wanted people to read it. I started to look into publishing. Then I remembered what I&rsquo;d read many, many times over in blogs and how-to books. Something I didn&rsquo;t really want to do. <strong>Take a break from it.</strong> You can barely see the story any more you&rsquo;re too close. You have to get away from it, and let it breathe.</p>

<p>So I did. I put it aside, and started my next novel. I actually started a few novels, and dabbled writing a few chapters of each. Two months later, I went back and read what would become Pulse and&hellip; well I&rsquo;m not going to say it was awful, but I certainly didn&rsquo;t love it as much as I had when I&rsquo;d left it last. I got to experience it fresh, and I saw many flaws with it that I hadn&rsquo;t seen when it had been my newborn baby. Now that it had grown a bit, I could see the ugly bits poking through.</p>

<p>The good thing about a book though is that you don&rsquo;t have to keep the ugly bits, so I dropped the first quarter of the book, dropped a few hanging chapters, merged a couple characters, and rejigged the final few chapters. The drop of the beginning of the story was the big part. 20,000 words to be precise. Gone. I then re-planned it how I wanted it to be and wrote hard. Now that I was sure what I wanted it to be it was much easier to burn through the words, and I managed to finish the new beginning (now a new 25,000 words) within only a few weeks. With these changes I also then had to go through the whole book again and change a lot of things to match the changes I&rsquo;d made to the start. This was a great way to pick up any extra grammar and spelling mistakes too.</p>

<p><strong>5. Beta readers and line-edits are essential</strong></p>

<p>Now that I was happy I needed new eyes on it. My alpha readers couldn&rsquo;t do it because they were as close to the story as I was. They had seen it grow and change, and to be honest they were burned out. I needed someone new. Enter another friend (who, lucky for me, is an English teacher!) to read the story as a whole and even give me a rough line-edit. I was excited.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t anticipate was how awful my grammar and spelling were. I mean, I read all the time! I&rsquo;d poured over Strunk and White! I&rsquo;d researched obscure English! I subscribe to Grammar Girl! I&rsquo;d taken a <em>damn course on grammar!!</em> How the hell was I so bad at this? Apparently I was, which makes me glad I&rsquo;d not decided to release the story right away. It would definitely not have been my best work, and am thankful I was given the chance to make it such.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>There we have it. A full year of writing from conception to completion. It started out as nothing more than an single-page synopsis, and became the story I love today, and all thanks to the things I learned along the way.</p>

<p>So basically I can narrow it down to five simple things to keep in mind while writing your own novel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cut yourself some slack</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Get people to read it</li>
<li>Take a break</li>
<li>Get new people to read it</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this helped someone out there, and if so (or if you do it some other way) let me know in the comments below!</p>
